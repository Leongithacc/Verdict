# Verdict

**The only optimizer that tells you when to stop optimizing.**

*(engine codename: WPEP — Windows Performance Engineering Platform)*

WPEP measures, diagnoses and recommends gaming-performance changes on Windows —
honestly, with statistics. For most popular "gaming tweaks" the honest answer is
*no measurable effect*, and WPEP is built to say exactly that.

Measurement and diagnosis are strictly read-only. WPEP can also **apply** the
subset of recommendations that are safely scriptable — but only the ones backed by
a primary source, only after you approve an exact dry-run, and every change is
journaled and reversible with one click. It never "optimizes everything", and it
never applies a placebo.

## What it does

- **Verdict** — scans your hardware and configuration (~30 read-only probes) and
  tells you what's worth doing, what's already optimal, and which popular tweaks
  are documented placebos. Every recommendation cites a primary source.
- **Measure** — a guided wizard: baseline runs → apply ONE change by hand → post
  runs → statistical verdict (Mann–Whitney + bootstrap CI, the run is the unit of
  observation). Includes scenario protocols (e.g. an automated Fortnite benchmark
  map) so your runs are actually comparable.
- **Noise gate** — if your scenario's run-to-run noise exceeds the minimum
  detectable effect threshold, WPEP refuses to emit a verdict instead of
  inventing one. Three outcomes: real effect · no measurable effect · no verdict.
- **Diagnostics** — kernel ETW capture of DPC/ISR latency per driver: finds the
  actual stutter culprit, or tells you there is none.
- **Knowledge Base** — 135 entries graded by evidence (strong / plausible /
  controversial / placebo / risky), each with primary sources, exact manual
  steps and rollback. The placebos are shown on purpose.
- **Apply** — for the entries that are safely scriptable (registry / power plan /
  bcdedit), Verdict can apply them one at a time or all the recommended ones at
  once, behind a single dry-run. Each write is verified by re-reading, journaled,
  and undoable per-change from the Changes page. A conflict guard prevents applying
  two mutually-exclusive tweaks. A subset of the entries is one-click; the rest stay
  manual (in-game / BIOS / driver panel) with deep-links where possible.
- **AI co-pilot** — natural-language assistant ("make Valorant smoother") that
  interprets your question against the verified catalog and proposes ONLY entries
  that actually exist in the KB (invented ids are dropped at the code level, not
  just in the prompt). Read-only — explains and suggests, never applies. Four
  swappable brains: Ollama (local, default — free and private), Anthropic Claude,
  Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT. Cloud API keys are encrypted at rest with DPAPI.
  See [docs/BRAINS.md](docs/BRAINS.md) for when to pick which brain.
- **Vanguard readiness card** — Secure Boot + TPM 2.0 status detected at runtime
  (registry + WMI) and shown on the Verdict page with one-click BIOS guides per
  motherboard vendor — useful for any anti-cheat or Win11 requirement.
- **System Noise Score (0–100)** — measures how noisy your machine is for gaming
  (startup apps, indexing, SysMain, Game DVR, transparency effects). Shown as a
  cockpit gauge. When the score is low, Verdict actively tells you the background
  tweaks won't produce measurable FPS gains — the opposite of "apply everything,
  guaranteed boost". See [docs/VS_HONE.md](docs/VS_HONE.md) for the honest
  positioning vs marketing-first competitors.
- **Gaming Session Mode** — `wpep session` (or the missile-launch button on the
  Verdict page) temporarily lowers `PriorityClass` to `BelowNormal` for a curated
  list of known "gaming noise" processes (Discord, OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive,
  Spotify, Slack, Zoom, Teams, WhatsApp/Telegram desktop, browser/store updaters).
  Restores on Ctrl+C or exit. **No process is ever killed, no service is ever
  stopped, the game itself is never touched** — anti-cheat safe by design.
- **BIOS guide QR** — for the manually-BIOS-only entries (XMP/EXPO, ReBAR, fTPM,
  PBO, Secure Boot, TPM, Above 4G, CSM, virtualization) a QR opens a per-vendor
  step-by-step page on your phone, reachable even while the PC is in BIOS.
  Hosted on GitHub Pages, content verified per ASUS/MSI/Gigabyte/ASRock, IT + EN.
- **Community evidence (V7)** — opt-in: anonymized outcomes (rig signature hash,
  tier, tweak id, outcome, measured delta) can be shared with a public backend
  (Cloudflare Worker + D1) and aggregated to "helped 73% of similar rigs". No
  PII ever, default OFF. Design in [docs/V7_REMOTE_BACKEND_DESIGN.md](docs/V7_REMOTE_BACKEND_DESIGN.md),
  privacy policy in [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).
- **Self-test** — `verify the apply engine works on this machine` before you trust
  it: a write→verify→undo round-trip on a throwaway registry key (no real setting
  touched).
- **Validate** — the pipeline certifies itself (A/A test + known-effect test)
  before you trust any verdict.
- **Report** — a shareable dark-theme HTML report of everything above, with the
  one-click-applicable entries badged and the changes you've applied listed.

## What it will never do

- Write anything without your explicit, per-change consent shown as an exact
  before→after dry-run first (measurement and diagnosis stay fully read-only)
- Apply anything that isn't a primary-source-backed entry in the Knowledge Base —
  no "optimize everything" button, no placebos, ever
- Make a change it can't undo (every write is journaled and reversible)
- Claim to measure end-to-end input latency (impossible in pure software)
- Show you an improvement that isn't statistically real
- Inject code, hook processes, read game memory, or draw overlays — WPEP never
  touches your game. Frame data comes from Windows' own event tracing (ETW), the
  same passive channel used by Intel PresentMon. We cannot offer guarantees on
  behalf of anti-cheat vendors, but WPEP belongs to no category anti-cheat
  systems target.

## Portable by design

One folder, no installer, no background services. All data (runs, reports,
settings, journals, tools) lives next to the exe. The only system writes are the
tweaks you explicitly approve — each journaled here and reversible. Delete the
folder and WPEP was never here.

## Usage

**App:** unzip → run `WPEP.exe`. The first scan needs no administrator;
Measure and Diagnostics ask for elevation only when you use them (ETW is
admin-only by Windows design).

**Verify your download.** Verdict is unsigned, so every release ships a
`SHA256SUMS.txt` next to the zip. Confirm the hash matches before running:

```powershell
Get-FileHash Verdict-<version>.zip -Algorithm SHA256   # compare with SHA256SUMS.txt
```

We verify PresentMon's hash before executing it; we hold our own binary to the
same bar.

**CLI** (`wpep.exe`, same engine):

```

## Method, in one paragraph

Frametime distributions are non-normal with fat tails, and run-to-run variance is
real. So: N runs per configuration in a repeatable scenario, the run as the unit
of observation (never pooled frames — pooling makes any microscopic delta
"significant"), Mann–Whitney permutation test plus bootstrap CI on the difference
of medians, an environment fingerprint per run (comparison blocked if your
driver/display/power plan changed), and a noise gate: when the baseline's minimum
detectable effect exceeds the threshold, no verdict is emitted. Outlier runs are
flagged, never silently dropped.

*(A note on the MDE, to be precise: the "minimum detectable effect" used by the
noise gate is estimated as the bootstrap CI half-width of a null comparison — the
baseline resampled against itself — relative to the median. It is a conservative
proxy for repeatability, not a formal 80%-power sample-size calculation; we prefer
to under-claim than to invent a false guarantee. When we test the four frametime
metrics, the single verdict is driven by the primary metric, median frametime —
"any of four significant" would inflate the false-positive rate, which is exactly
the placebo pattern this tool exists to avoid.)*

## Build

.NET 10 SDK → `dotnet build` · `dotnet test` (350+ tests). WPF app in
`src/WPEP.App`, CLI in `src/WPEP.Cli`, engine modules underneath — UI and CLI
share the same services. (If a parallel build crashes an MSBuild node, build
single-node: `dotnet build -m:1 --disable-build-servers`.)

For shipping a new release, see [docs/RELEASE_V1.1_RUNBOOK.md](docs/RELEASE_V1.1_RUNBOOK.md):
the short version is `git tag v1.x && git push origin v1.x` — the
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds and publishes
the GitHub release automatically.
